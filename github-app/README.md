# rescribe-github

Connect GitHub to Rescribe, allowing for automatic indexing on a push. The Rescribe platform enables high-performance searching through public repositories and your own, increasing productivity and enabling better collaboration and sharing. Each time you commit a change, Rescribe indexes your code based on the default configuration or a custom one defined in the `.rescriberc.yml` file, enabling you to search for it in the future.

## Features

- **Index your code and view live changes**
  Save your code to the Rescribe search engine, ensuring secure indexing and reliable search.
- **Automate indexing**
  Rescribe's built-in Continuous Deployment runs the indexing for you, so you do not have to add an indexing step to your CI/CD service.
- **And much more!**
  Rescribe includes many features for collaborating, searching, and sharing with friends, enabling you to find the code you want when you need it.
