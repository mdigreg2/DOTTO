### What we have so far
  - As of now the reScribe team has accomplished the following goals
    - Language parsing for java, along with partial language parsing for C++ and Python
    - A reasonably developed GraphQL API that can handle the management of user queries, intramodule messaging, and database connections
    - A hookup to a third party searching service to use post query enrichment
    - A language prediction model which can determine whether the user's query related to C++, Python, Java, or Any
    - A funcitonal and authenticated CLI, published on NPM, which can handle API requests
    - A functional and authenticated GitHub Application which can connect reScribe to GitHub repositories
    - A website which has the main page styled properly, along with a series of in-development pages

### What we need
  - To be a success and launch to customers, reScribe would need the following things
    - General debugging on deployment systems to ensure quality
    - Completion of the currently in-development library prediciton model
    - Full integration of our query enrichments with the third party searching service
    - Completion of the search page, repostiories page, user page, end file view / edit pages on the website
    - Our production Data Base format and data models to be finalized to the point that we would not have to frequently reinitilize the Data Base
  
### By when do we need it?
- We should have version one done by the end of the semester
