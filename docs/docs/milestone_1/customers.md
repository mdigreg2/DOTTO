## Our Ideal Customers

- Our ideal customers come in two flavors:
  - A corporate software development manager who works on a large (possibly legacy) codebase
  - An independent software engineer who frequently reuses components from their own past projects or from the open source community. Think web-developer

- The corporate execitive would find the organization of their existing codebase and the ability of their subordinates to easily reference components within their codebase to be the most useful. They would work with their development teams to organize all of the source code, allowing for anyone to be able to view previously-written code (with scoped permissions) in the company
- Frequenctly these codebases are tens of thousands (if not hundreds of thousands) of lines of code dispersed over dozens of repos. Virtually nobody is intimately familiar with all of it, and those that are would not have the time to walk more junior developers through it

- The independent software engineer would drive the most value with reScribe's ability to recover components from the open source community. Generally speaking they wouldn't have the scale of the corporate client, and would therefore have less trouble finding / recalling prior work. Being able to grab snippets of code that others have written would save the independent developer the most time and money
