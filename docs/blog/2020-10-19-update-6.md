This week we were mainly working on getting the edit page for files working correctly. It still needs to be tested in production, but locally there do not seem to be any major bugs.

Pridhvi is still working on the library relational map using tensorflow, and it is a big learning experience for him. We are trying a new approach which should work better for getting libraries, using graph theory. Hopefully some progress will be made soon, so that it can be incorporated into the search algorithm on the api side.

This week we were also working on some organizational challenges, planning the next few weeks out with the break, and fixing bugs as they arose.
