This week we continued developing the nlp algorithms for the final search engine. This required using Bigquery to download source files to use for training, as well as parsing and cleaning the data for training.

On the frontend side, Asif was busy working working on the repositories and projects pages, and I was working on the file processing pipeline. This pipeline is used for optimizing images and other user-uploaded content. The foundations are there, and by the end of the week this functionality should be completed. What remains unknown is how the cdn will work to cache requests to the image optimizer, or if this functionality is needed at all (most likely, it isn't).

The search engine continues to be under active development, with the hope of a working prototype soon.
