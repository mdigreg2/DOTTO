This week we completed development on the dataload and datacleaning portions of our library relational map.
This consisted of leveraging Google Bigquery to download java files from their "github" dataset, and then parsing out import statements using our ANTLR API. 

This also marks the first time that we have been able to use reScribe to help develop another part of reScribe! 

Progress was also made with regards to integrating the NLP language prediction into our search result. The query is functional and we can get a proper response from all services, however, the actual search performance seems to be lacking. More research has to be done on whether or not it is a flaw in our model / training, our retrieval method, or both. 

Lastly, development continues on our search results and our resopsitories page!
