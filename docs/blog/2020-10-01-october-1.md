This week we started working on the project whitepaper. So far we have the Absrtact completed along with a draft for some of the content in the more technical sections. 
Currently, most of our development is focused around integrating NLP outputs with our API and with NLP itself. To that end, we have almost completed adding "language" 
filters to the query, have drafted a Word2vec model, and have identified several shortcomings with how we index files. More thought should be put into the "indexed attributes"
of every file we process. 

Progress on the search result styling and the repositories page has also been made. Those should be complete soon.
