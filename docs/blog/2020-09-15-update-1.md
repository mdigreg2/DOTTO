This week we were working mainly on nlp integration to the core codebase. This required finishing the nlp models for processing user-generated queries, and classifying the type of language or library they are searching. Now, we will be focusing on fixing training in the cloud and adding more layers to our nlp implementation.

On Thursday, the reScribe team will meet with our advisor Mukund to discuss our current progress in the senior design project and get advice on our implementation.
