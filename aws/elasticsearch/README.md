# elasticsearch deployment

- deploy elasticsearch in aws in vpc mode
- access elasticsearch using [this](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonElastiCache/latest/mem-ug/accessing-elasticache.html). doesn't work well
- maybe [this](https://www.jeremydaly.com/access-aws-vpc-based-elasticsearch-cluster-locally/)
